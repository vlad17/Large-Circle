-- runFindCircle update circle fit decoder w h

-- Uses the 'update' update handler to let the GUI thread know
-- when the reference to the 'circle' has changed, which occurs every
-- few hundred milliseconds, with a new generation's solution to the

--
-- Uses 'decoder' for decoding chromosomes
--
-- Assumes canvas size is w x h
--
-- Uses fitness function 'fit'

-- Call does not exit.
